Learning Github repository

This edit is to demostrated how branches work on GitHub.
It is 6:41 am and breakfast is just around the corner!

I learned how to:
*Create an open source repository
*Start and manage a new branch
*Change a file and committ those changes to GitHub
*Opened and merged a Pull Request

Now, I am practicing without reference to the tutorial.
I will only use it in the case I am stuck or make a mistake.
Learning fuels growth and I am determined to grow!
